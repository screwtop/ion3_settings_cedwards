Ion3 winprop notes for FontForge

Class:	fontforge	[note lowercase!]
Instance:	fontforge

various window titles:
"Open Font"
"FontForge"	splash screen (make transient?)
"Layers"	
"Tools"	tool palette
"<GLYPH> at <INDEX> from <FONT-TITLE> <UNICODE-LETTER-NAME>
"Font Information for <FONT-TITLE>"
"Metrics For <FONT-TITLE>"
"Preferences..."
"Point Info"
"Set Width..."	transient
"Kern Pair Closeup..."	maybe transient

Specific issues:
I think the program tries to manage the Tools (and perhaps Layers) windows itself.  They certainly come and go all the time, resist closing, and generally go crazy when tiled.

Try the following xres:
Gdraw.GWidget.BrokenPalettes

Alternatively, View > Palettes > Docked Palettes will place the palettewindows within the glyph editor window.
