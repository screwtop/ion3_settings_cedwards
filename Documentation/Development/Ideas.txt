Functionality that'd be nice to have in Ion:

 - A Windows Start Menu equivalent: a menu for launching any application, grouped by category.  The launchers could switch to the appropriate workspace (if appropriate).
 - A Window Quick Launch Bar equivalent: a single-click menu for a small number of frequently-used applications and utilities.
 - Some way of keeping the scratchpad frame on top while allowing focus to move to windows underneath.
 - A Workspace + Frame or Workspace + application hierarchical switcher.  Maybe even include switching between documents if relevant/possible.


If you have multiple alternative bindings (keystrokes, mouse actions, etc.) to map to the same function, it would be nice to do it using a table of events, listing the action only once.  I think we'd need a Lua map() function to do this.

-- Lua map() function from
-- http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lua_Functional_Programming/Functions
function map(func, array)
  local new_array = {}
  for i,v in ipairs(array) do
    new_array[i] = func(v)
  end
  return new_array
end


NOTE: ioncore.popen_bgread() lets you run external functions and do stuff with the result!
